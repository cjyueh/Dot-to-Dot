* **0** Incomplete
* **1** Meets expectations
* **2** Exceeds expectations

| | Score | Commentary |
|---|---|---|
| **Project WorkFlow** | 1 | Nice readme, way to learn how to use markup for it! You should definitely have more than one user story though! You could break up your one (epic) story into at least three. Overall, it shows that you put thought into wire-framing the game out before it was built. The final design is clear and well-polished. |
| **Technical Requirements** | 1 | You've demonstrated you have a very solid understanding of web technologies. The challenge you set for yourself was not trivial, but you showed great effort in managing to devise a solution that achieved most of your goals at the end of the day. |
| **Creativity** | 1 | Fun idea, I like how the design turned out. Nice job with the animations, happy to see you were curious enough to integrate something new into your project! |
| **Code Quality** | 1.5 | The functions are well named, code is commented properly, the program is defined before the window is loaded but called only then. These are all good practices, keep it up! Consider refactoring your hardcoded data into something more reusable, like an object, and putting it in a separate file for more readability. |
| **Problem Solving** | 2 | You demonstrated a high level of independence and level-headedness in tackling a range of problems. I'm impressed at how you are able to break down a problem into smaller, solvable pieces and steadily work through each to compose a cohesive solution. Really solid work! |
